# EmailApp

Very basic Android E-mailHandler app using API 28: Android 9.0 (Pie). For learning purposes only!

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) is used as the authentication framework for Google authentication and e-mails are sent using the [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/).

Uses [Firebase UI](https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/firebaseui-android/) to reduce the amount of boilerplate code.
